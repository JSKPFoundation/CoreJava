String Pool:
===========
String Pool is possible only because String is immutable in Java and it’s implementation of String interning concept.
String pool is also example of Flyweight design pattern.
String pool helps in saving a lot of space for Java Runtime although it takes more time to create the String.


I have a doubt regarding the below line of statements.Anyone can get back to me with correct solution?

Q)How many string is getting created in below statement?

String str = new String("Cat");

In above statement, either 1 or 2 string will be created.
If there is already a string literal “Cat” in the pool, then only one string “str” will be created in the pool.
If there is no string literal “Cat” in the pool, then it will be first created in the pool and then in the heap space,
so total 2 string objects will be created.

does above statement right?
